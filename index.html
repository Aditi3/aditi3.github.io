            <p>
                During my time at CleverTap, I had the opportunity to contribute to all major CleverTap SDK releases. I
                led the development and rollout of the open-source CleverTap iOS SDK and the iOS components of hybrid
                SDKs.
                My team and I built, released, and maintained analytics and user engagement framework SDKs, which are
                integrated into thousands of applications used by millions of users. I collaborated with developers,
                designers, and product/business managers to deliver new SDK features aligned with the Product Roadmap.
                Beyond development, I worked closely with the customer success team to resolve customer queries and
                ensure seamless SDK integration and installation.

                I spent around six months at Drivezy, during which I had an exciting and impactful role.
                I was responsible for revamping and developing both the customer and partner iOS applications from
                scratch using Swift.

                During this time, I gained hands-on experience with seamless payment gateway integration, Google Maps,
                Firebase, Google Crashlytics, and Apple’s Contact and Calendar frameworks.

            <p>
                I joined Holachef as the first tech team member and had the opportunity to independently develop and
                manage the iOS application from scratch in a fast-paced startup environment. I collaborated closely with
                product managers, engineers, and UI/UX designers to shape the app’s development.

                Over time, I pushed around 15 updates, including three major version changes, to ensure quick bug fixes,
                optimal performance, and a seamless user experience. Holachef gave me the platform to design app logic
                and UI/UX for mobile development.

                On the job, I learned and integrated payment gateways like PayU, Paytm, Mobikwik, and Simpl, along with
                Google Maps, Core Data design, API integration (JSON parsing), and CocoaPods.

                After getting a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, I begin my work journey and joined Aryavrat,
                a Project-based organisation as an iOS trainee.
                Within a span of 2months, I got a confirmation letter as an iOS Engineer. I had worked with a team of 5
                members and successfully delivered more than 9 projects.
                Participated in app Logic design, UI/UX development & API integrations and learnt technologies like
                Apple Push Notification Service, Apple Map Integration, Social Media Integration (Facebook, Twitter,
                LinkedIn), Dropbox integration, Image and Video Compression as per client requirements and implemented
                in applications.
